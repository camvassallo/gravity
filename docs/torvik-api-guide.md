# Barttorvik API Guide

Unofficial documentation for the barttorvik.com data endpoints used for college basketball analytics. These are public, unauthenticated HTTP GET endpoints that return full-season data dumps.

> **Note:** There is no official API documentation from barttorvik.com. This guide is based on observed behavior and may change without notice. Replace `{year}` with the desired NCAA season year (e.g., `2026`).

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | URL | Format | Compression | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Player Stats | `https://barttorvik.com/getadvstats.php?year={year}&csv=1` | CSV | None | Season averages for all D1 players |
| Player Stats (Date Range) | `https://barttorvik.com/pslice.php?year={year}&top=364&start={start}&end={end}&csv=1` | CSV | None | Player stats filtered to a date range |
| Team Stats | `https://barttorvik.com/{year}_team_results.json` | JSON | None | Team-level rankings and efficiency metrics |
| Game Stats | `https://barttorvik.com/{year}_all_advgames.json.gz` | JSON | Gzip | Per-game, per-player box scores for all D1 games |

### Authentication

None required. All endpoints are publicly accessible via HTTP GET.

### Rate Limiting

No known rate limits, but be respectful -- these are not officially published APIs.

### Date Filtering

The `pslice.php` endpoint supports server-side date filtering for player stats (see Section 1b). Other endpoints return the complete dataset; date filtering must be done client-side.

## 1b. Player Stats (Date Range)

**URL:** `GET https://barttorvik.com/pslice.php?year={year}&top=364&start={start}&end={end}&csv=1`

**Format:** CSV (headerless -- columns are positional, same schema as `getadvstats.php`)

**Response:** One row per player, containing stats aggregated only over games within the specified date range. Critical for preventing tournament data leakage during model training.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `year` | integer | Yes | NCAA season year (e.g., `2026`) |
| `top` | integer | Yes | Number of teams to include (use `364` for all D1 teams) |
| `start` | string | Yes | Start date in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20251101`) |
| `end` | string | Yes | End date in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20260316`) |
| `csv` | integer | Yes | Must be `1` to get CSV format |

### Column Schema

Same positional column layout as `getadvstats.php` (see Section 1 above). All 64 columns are present in the same order.

### Usage Notes

- Use `start={year-1}1101` (November 1) to capture the full regular season from the start
- Use `end` set to the tournament cutoff date to exclude tournament games from player aggregates
- This prevents data leakage when building player features for training/backtesting

### Example Request

```
curl "https://barttorvik.com/pslice.php?year=2026&top=364&start=20251101&end=20260316&csv=1"

## Inverse Stats

Some statistics are "better" when lower. When applying color coding or percentile rankings, invert the scale for:

| Stat | Field(s) | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Defensive Rating | `drtg`, `adrtg` | Lower = better defense |
| Turnover Percentage | `to_per` | Lower = fewer turnovers |
| Personal Fouls | `pf`, `pfr` | Lower = fewer fouls |

---

## Common Patterns

### Linking Players Across Endpoints

Use `pid` (player ID) to join player stats, game stats, and any derived data. The `pid` field is consistent across all endpoints for the same season.

### Linking Games

Use `muid` (matchup unique ID) to group all player rows belonging to the same game.

### Season Year Convention

The `year` parameter refers to the spring calendar year of the NCAA season. For example, the 2025-26 season uses `year=2026`.
